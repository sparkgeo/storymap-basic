# Story Map Basic

The Story Map Basic app is a simple map viewer with a minimalist user interface. Apart from the title bar and an optional legend, the map fills the screen. Use this app to let your map speak for itself. Your users can click features on the map to get more information in pop-ups.

This application is part of the ArcGIS Online and can be accessed from the ArcGIS Online's map viewer Share window. 
This repository provides the application source code for developers that want to customize the application.

For more information, including a gallery of examples and a step-by-step tutorial, please see the [Story Map Basic](http://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/app-list/basic/) page on the [Esri Story Maps website](http://storymaps.arcgis.com/).
This application is based on the [Viewer configurable application template](https://github.com/Esri/Viewer).

## Instructions
First create your Story Map Basic in ArcGIS Online using the [step-by-step tutorial](http://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/app-list/basic/tutorial/).
Once your story is ready, you have to find its ID in ArcGIS Online. The ID is a 32 character string that you will find in your web browser's address bar when you are viewing the story.

1. [Download the application](http://links.esri.com/storymaps/story_map_basic_zip)
2. Deploy the application on your webserver. See [FAQ](#how-to-deploy-the-application-on-a-web-server) for details
3. Edit `config\defaults.js`, find the `appid` property on line 21 and paste in your application ID
4. Navigate to index.html (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1/MapBasic/index.html`)

Enjoy!
You can continue to use the configuration interface in ArcGIS Online to modify your story.

*If you are using Portal for ArcGIS, you have to configure `config\defaults.js` > `sharinghost` line 63. For example if you Portal is accessible at `acme.com/gis/`, the value should be `"sharinghost": location.protocol + "//" + "acme.com/gis/"`
Optionally you can also [configure the application](#can-the-application-be-used-offline) to use the ArcGIS API for JavaScript included on your Portal.*

Alternatively, the application can be configured with a webmap id instead of an application id (see `config\defaults.js` > `webmap` on line 22. 
In that scenario, all the configuration has to be done through through `config\defaults.js`.

## Maptiks integration
1. Add a path to Sparkgeo's Maptiks wrapper in index.html:

    ```
    var dojoConfig = {
        // ...
        paths: { maptiks: '//cdn.maptiks.com/esri3' }
    };
    ```
2. Add the maptiks/mapWrapper class to js/main.js:

    ```
    define(["maptiks/mapWrapper",
    // ...
        function(mapWrapper,
        // ...
    ```
    
3. Add Maptiks code to js/main.js

    ```
    _createWebMap: function (itemInfo, params) {
        // ...         
        return arcgisUtils.createMap(itemInfo, "mapDiv", {
            // ...
        }).then(lang.hitch(this, function (response) {
            // ...
            var container = response.map.container;
            var maptiksMapOptions = {
                extent: response.map.extent,
                maptiks_trackcode: "MAPTIKS_TRACKCODE",
                maptiks_id: "AN_ID"
          };
          mapWrapper(container, maptiksMapOptions, response.map);
    ```

## FAQ

### What are the supported browsers?
The application is supported on Internet Explorer 9 and above, Chrome, Firefox, Safari and the most recent tablet and smartphone devices.

### Can the application be used without ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS?
Yes, by setting `app/templatesConfig.js` > `useLocalWebmap` to `true`, the application will load the local definition of a webmap defined stored in `demoMap.js`. 
To modify this file, and add your own layer, see the [web map specification](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-web-map-json/) or inspect the network request when loading a map.

### Can the application be used offline?
Yes, by using Portal for ArcGIS and configuring the application to use the ArcGIS API for Javascript included with the Portal. 

Change all references to the ArcGIS API for JavaScript in index.html to refer to your local copy of the API. 
Search for the references containing `//js.arcgis.com/3.15` and replace this portion of the reference with the url to your local install.
For example: `//acme.com/gis/jsapi/jsapi` where `gis` is the name of your Web Adaptor.

### How to deploy the application on a web server?
If you are not familiar with web servers here is three solutions:
 * Use a free hosting service like [Surge](https://surge.sh/), View our blog post: [Host Your Story Maps for Free with Surge](https://developerscorner.storymaps.arcgis.com/host-your-story-maps-for-free-with-surge-8bddcc4cd580#.6hti19kg1)
 * Use the web server that comes with your server Operating System. On Windows this is Internet Information Services (IIS), if you have a `C:\inetpub\wwwroot` folder on your computer, you should be able to access it's content using `http://localhost`
 * On Windows or Mac OS, use a simple web server like [Mongoose](https://code.google.com/p/mongoose/) (not recommended for production)

If you are experiencing some rendering issues like improper symbol appearing instead of icons, you will have an extra configuration to perform. Some servers require to configure a new mime type to be able to serve fonts correctly. See the following links for more information:

 * [IIS Mime types](http://codingstill.com/2013/01/set-mime-types-for-web-fonts-in-iis/)
 * [Properly serve webfonts](http://blog.symbolset.com/properly-serve-webfonts)

## Requirements
* Notepad or HTML editor
* Some background with HTML/CSS/Javascript
* Experience with the [ArcGIS Javascript API](http://links.esri.com/javascript) is helpful
